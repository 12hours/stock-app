=== Application modules
Application is divided in couple of modules (layers): +
 - `dao` and `dao-api`: `dao` module contain DAO objects, it handles database connection as well. `dao-api` is simply
  API for DAO objects. DAO classes are supposed to be accessed only by `service` layer.
 - `service` and `service-api`: `service` module currently works as a proxy between
 `dao` and rest of the application. Currently it's main role is exception handling, validation and logging.
 - `client` and `client-api`: represents a client classes that accesses data through `service` layer. `client-api`
 interfaces are used as much as possible, so `client` layer classes always ready to be replaced with another
 implementation.
 - `web-app` module: contains client web-application
 - `rest-app` module: to be implemented.

As diagram shows, apllication is divided into two logical parts: `web-app` ('frontend') and `rest-app` ('backend').
Function of `web-app` is to present data to user. `web-app` can obtain data by accessing `client`.
And as `web-app` depends only on `client-api` it has no concern in how `client` will get data from database.
Current application structure implies either direct invoking of `service` layer or using of rest-api. This way
`rest-app` appears to be optional.

=== Database backend
[.lead]
*Overview* +
Application is supposed to be database agnostic (at least H2 and MySQL databases support is expected). Currently only H2
database is used. +

Database consists of 6 tables:

 - `product`
 - `product_type`
 - `supplier`
 - `user`
 - `product_income`
 - `product_outcome`

image::diagram.png[]

Database table and column names, as well as data types definitions are specified in `${basedir}/dao/database
.properties` file
making them flexible for changing. This file is proccessed by Maven during `dao` module building.

[.lead]
*Database configuration* +

Firstly, database tapy should be specified as application property, e.g.
----
app.database.type = h2
----
Currently only H2 database is supported;
`DataSource` and SQL scripts will be configured according to this property.

Then database user is inclined to import `DaoConfig` into Spring configurtion class.
[source,java]
----
...
import com.epam.mentoring.data.config.DaoConfig;

@Configuration
@Import(DaoConfig.class)
public class AppConfig {
...
----

After that `DataSource` object can be autowired into configuration
for using in declarations of DAO beans:
[source,java]
----
...
import com.epam.mentoring.data.config.DaoConfig;

@Configuration
@Import(DaoConfig.class)
public class AppConfig {

    @Autowired
    DataSource datasource;

    @Bean
    IProductDao productDao(){
        return new ProductDaoImpl(datasource);
    }
...
